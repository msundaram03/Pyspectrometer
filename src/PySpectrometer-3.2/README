This is a quick hacky fix for Bullseye!

Why? Bullseye has broken the original program in that the Picam has been radically updated.
It may be possible to re-compile opencv to support it, however this can take several hours to complete!
Additionally peakutils and scipy appear to have been compiled against a version of numpy that is not installed :-(

Since PySpectrometer only requires two functions from these libs (savgol filter, and peak indexes) I have included them as a single library specfunctions.py
This needs to be present for PySpectrometer 3.2 to work!

File list:
pyspectrometer-v3.2.py The Program!
specfunctions.py

Additional bugs fixed:
Image and CSV export filenames are now windows compatible!
Setting the savgol filter to 16 causes a crash with the new library. Limited to 15, which is fine!


INSTALLATION:

You must install the following dependencies:

sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
sudo apt-get install python3-pil.imagetk

Note You must run the following:

sudo raspi-config

Go to Interface options and Enable Legacy Camera Support (requires a reboot)


Run the program with:  python3 pyspectrometer-v3.2.py

Have fun!

(And stay tuned for an upcoming, newer, bigger and better version of this software!)
